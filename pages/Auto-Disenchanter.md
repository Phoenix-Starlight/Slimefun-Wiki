It requires a source of electricity, see [Electric Machines](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Machines).
You place the slimefun or vanilla tool in the left slot, and a indicator will appear showing the progress and how much energy it has. Upon completion, the right side will produce the respective tool, unenchanted, and a enchanted book holding the enchants of that tool.
